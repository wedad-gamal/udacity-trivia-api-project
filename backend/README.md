## Backend

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:

   ```
   python -m virtualenv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

   > **Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:

   ```
   source env/Scripts/activate
   ```

2. From the backend folder run

   ```
   pip install requirements.txt.
   ```

   All required packages are included in the requirements file.

   ```
   export FLASK_APP=flaskr
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run
   ```

The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

## Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:

```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

## Tests

In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

To run the tests, run

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

for windows run

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql postgres
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.
